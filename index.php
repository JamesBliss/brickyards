					<p>It may help your dog to settle and feel more at home if you bring your dog’s favourite blanket or a toy.</p>
					<p>We provide vetbed bedding, plastic beds and all other equipment for our guests’ comfort. If your dog is a chewer we ask that you provide the bedding.</p>

						<h2>Small print</h2>
						<p>All dogs must hold a current vaccination certificate, if you do not bring your certificate with you and we can’t verify it with your vet we can’t board your dog.</p>
						<p>We don’t insist on kennel cough vaccination but please ask your vets advice.</p>
						<p>Should we feel the need to call a vet for an existing health condition, all fees incurred are the owner’s responsibility. </p>
						<p>All pets should be worm and flea free at the time of boarding.</p>
						<p>Should any pet on arrival require treatment for internal or external parasites (fleas, worms etc) then a charge will be levied for this.</p>
						<p>All medical and dietary requirements should be discussed prior to your pet boarding with us.</p>
						<p>Dogs are insured while they are boarding with us, excluding fees in connection with any conditions that exist prior to boarding.</p>
						<p>All pets requiring veterinary treatment will be seen by our local veterinary practice unless prior arrangements are made.</p>
						<p>Whilst every possible attention is given to each pet boarded with us, it is done at the owners risk. </p>
						<p>Pets from the same family who share, who we feel need to be separated in the interests of safety, will be separated and an additional charge will be levied. In such cases your emergency contact will be advised.</p>
						<p>Current or ongoing problems with your dog’s health or temperament must be notified to us at the time of booking. We reserve the right to refuse any pet that we consider to be of an unreliable temperament, or sick at the time of booking or arrival.</p>
